<summary>How to get started</summary>
After launching the game, just click on "Options" > "PIDS Visual Editor".
If no resource packs with JCM PIDS are loaded, you'll see a screen informing you no compatible resource packs are loaded. If this appears but you do have a JCM PID resource pack, please create a bug report.

If you don't have one, just go back to options and load the necessary resource packs, and then when you go to "PIDS Visual Editor" you should see it loaded it now!

You should see something like:

I have added some tooltips for the text fields to hopefully help you understand what they are.
The top two arrows are to cycle between different resource packs, and the second set of two arrows are to cycle between PID templates ("id"s).

There's also a preview render of the current PID template!

Changes are automatically saved.

**If you'd like to manually create a new PID template instead, for now please consider using the [Visual PIDS Editor program](https://github.com/dooji2/doojis-jcm-pids). This will be available by this mod in the future too.**

This mod should be used with Joban's Client Mod but is not required. It is only compatible with JCM PIDS resource packs.
